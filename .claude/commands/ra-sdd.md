As a Senior Solution Architect, your task is to read the product use case description, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and architecture diagrams to produce a comprehensive **System Design Document (SDD)** specification.

Input sources to analyze:
- Use case description from: $ARGUMENT/usecase.md
- Functional Requirements from: $ARGUMENT/ra-fr.md 
- Non-Functional Requirements from: $ARGUMENT/ra-nfr.md
- Architecture Diagrams from: $ARGUMENT/ra-diagrams.md

Before starting the system design, first read and analyze all four input files to understand:
- Business context and use case scope
- Functional capabilities and user stories required
- Quality attributes and non-functional constraints

Formatting rules:
- Write the report in syntax-perfect Markdown with proper headings, lists, and formatting
- Reference and enhance the architecture diagrams from ra-diagrams.md
- Include specific technology choices with justification
- Provide quantifiable metrics where applicable
- Reference specific FRs and NFRs that drive architectural decisions
- Cross-reference all architectural components with the visual diagrams

Guardrails:
- Focus on high-level design, not detailed implementation
- Ensure architecture addresses all identified NFRs
- Consider cloud-native patterns and best practices
- Balance complexity with maintainability
- Do not generate any HTML, JavaScript, or other asset files
- Reference and build upon the architecture diagrams from ra-diagrams.md
- Provide comprehensive written specifications that complement the visual diagrams
