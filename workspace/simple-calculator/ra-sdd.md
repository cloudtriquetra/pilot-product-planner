# Simple Calculator - System Design Document (SDD)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Simple Calculator System is architected as a client-side single-page application (SPA) delivering basic arithmetic functionality through a responsive web interface. The solution employs a stateless, event-driven architecture with three primary containers: UI Components for user interaction, Calculation Engine for mathematical processing, and Web Application layer for coordination. 

Key architectural decisions prioritize performance through client-side computation, accessibility through WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, and reliability through comprehensive error handling. The technology stack leverages modern web standards (HTML5, ES2015+, CSS3) with minimal dependencies, enabling offline operation and cross-browser compatibility.

The architecture delivers sub-50ms response times, mathematical precision to 15 decimal places, and seamless operation across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices through responsive design and CDN-based content delivery.
