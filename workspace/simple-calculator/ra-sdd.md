# Simple Calculator - System Design Document (SDD)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Simple Calculator system is architected as a client-side single-page application delivering basic arithmetic operations through a responsive web interface. The solution employs a three-tier component architecture with UI Components, Calculation Engine, and Web Application layers, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability.
