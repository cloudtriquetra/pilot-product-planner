# Simple Calculator

I need to build a web-based calculator that works on all devices. It should handle basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users should be able to enter numbers either by clicking buttons or using their keyboard. 

The calculator needs to show the current calculation on a display screen and handle errors gracefully - like when someone tries to divide by zero. I want it to remember the last calculation result so users can continue working with that number. It should also have a clear button to reset everything and maybe an all-clear to wipe the memory completely.
