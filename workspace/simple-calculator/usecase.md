# Simple Calculator

I need to build a web-based calculator that works on all devices. It should handle basic math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users should be able to enter numbers either by clicking buttons or using their keyboard. 

The calculator needs to show the current calculation on a display screen and handle errors gracefully - like when someone tries to divide by zero. I want it to remember the last calculation result so users can continue working with that number. It should also have a clear button to reset everything and maybe an all-clear to wipe the memory completely.

The interface should be clean and intuitive, similar to a physical calculator that people are familiar with. It needs to work well on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop computers. The buttons should be large enough for touch screens but not take up too much space on smaller devices.

For accessibility, it should work with screen readers and support keyboard navigation. Users should be able to tab through the buttons and use Enter to "click" them. The display should be readable with high contrast and a clear font.

Performance-wise, calculations should happen instantly when buttons are pressed. The app should work offline once it's loaded and not require any server connections. I want it to be a simple, reliable tool that just works without any complicated features or registration requirements.
