# Functional Requirements: Maximize Profit Generation for Fixed Income Investments

## 1. Context

This system optimizes profit generation for fixed income investments by analyzing customer risk profiles and market conditions across multiple instruments (bonds, swaps, FX, fixed deposits), currencies (USD, SGD, MYR, INR, JPY), and tenors (30 days to 50 years). The platform considers market risks, counterparty risks, country profiles, and capital protection requirements to recommend optimal investment strategies that maximize returns while respecting customer constraints.

## 6. Assumptions & Open Questions

### Assumptions:
- Market data feeds are available for all supported instruments and currencies
- Customers have pre-approved investment mandates and limits
- Regulatory frameworks are stable during development period
- Transaction costs are known and relatively stable
- Capital protection requirements are clearly defined per customer

### Open Questions:
- [ ] What is the acceptable latency for recommendation generation?
- [ ] Should the system support algorithmic trading execution or recommendations only?
- [ ] How frequently should risk parameters be recalibrated?
- [ ] What is the minimum investment amount threshold?
- [ ] Should the system support portfolio rebalancing recommendations?
- [ ] What external data providers will be integrated?
