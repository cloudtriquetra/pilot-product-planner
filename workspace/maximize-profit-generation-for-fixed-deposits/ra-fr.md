# Functional Requirements: Maximize Profit Generation for Fixed Income Investments

## 1. Context

This system optimizes profit generation for fixed income investments by analyzing customer risk profiles and recommending optimal investment allocations across bonds, swaps, FX, and fixed deposits. The platform considers multiple currencies (USD, SGD, MYR, INR, JPY), various tenors (30 days to 30 years), market risks, counterparty risks, country profiles, and capital protection requirements to maximize returns while maintaining acceptable risk levels.
